            <h1>Today's group of people I fucking despise: Smokers</h1>
            <p>this one isn't too long I just don't want to split this into several tweets
                <br>
                <br>
                I don't care if you feel the need to destroy your own lungs. I don't care if you want to fucking die.
                But please, for the love of god I am BEGGING YOU on my hands and knees, at least be considerate of
                others and stay the fuck away from me. I have to suffer because you troglodyte are not able to stable
                without tearing your lungs apart every 30 minutes. When you are told not to smoke inside the house,
                don't fucking smoke inside. Get the fuck outside. jesus fucking christ.
                <br>
                <br>
