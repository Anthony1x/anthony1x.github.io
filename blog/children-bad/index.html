            <h1>Why I choose not to have children, and why I think it's always better to adopt</h1>
            <p>I'll admit, my previous ramble on this topic sucked. It was written when I was really angry
                about something I honestly can't even remember anymore and all it was was several paragraphs of me
                blaming
                people that chose to bear children for all that is bad in the world. I apologize for the incoherence and
                I
                owe it to myself to make myself more clear, because I still stand behind it.<br>

                <br>
                This quote has been occupying my mind for a while now and it perfectly encompasses my thoughts on the
                topic
                of natalism, so I wanted to start my ramble with it.<br>
                <br>
                Let's start from the beginning. I identify myself as an antinatalist. Fundamentally, that means that I
                follow the philosophical viewpoint that assigns negative value to birth. I believe it to be better not
                to
                exist at all. If I could choose right now, I'd rather never've been born at all.<br>
                <br>
                Why is that?<br>
                <br>
                Now, let me begin with something reasonable. For a loving parent, I'd think it's perfectly normal for
                them
                to want to give their child the best life it could possibly have. They don't want it to experience
                trauma.
                They don't want it to be bullied at school. They don't want it to be kidnapped or worse. They will do
                everything in their might to make sure this does not happen, whatever may be the case.<br>
                <br>
                Unfortunately, we do not live in an environment where such awful occurrences do not happen. You could be
                a
                perfect parent to your child and it will, without doubt, experience injustice. It will be hurt. It will
                be
                treated unjust at some point in their life. Those are things that every human being is guaranteed to
                experience.<br>
                <br>
                And that's just the best-case scenario. Bad people exist. Your child could also be a victim of bullying.
                Your child could be the victim of murder, or sexual harassment, or even things not influenced by humans,
                like illnesses. If you're optimistic, you might think "Oh, that's not gonna happen". And you might be
                right.
                But what if you aren't? What if your child is born blind? What if your child gets abducted, gets harmed,
                and
                will be traumatized for the rest of its life? That'd be fucking awful. Of course it would be. Not a
                single,
                good-willed person would want their child to go through that. Yet the chances of exactly that happening
                are
                not nil.<br>
                <br>
                You might still make the best out of the situation, but that child you have will still have to go
                through
                it, having a harder time than everyone else.<br>
                <br>
                This is what I mean when I say you're "gambling" with your child's life. Because your child did not
                choose
                to be here. Your child is the product of a chemical process in your brain, wanting you to reproduce. But
                now
                it's here, and it can not choose to stop existing. It will have to live with the pain. <br>
                <br>
                I don't see the point in that.<br>
                <br>
                Of course I am not looking at the bright sight of things. Of course good things happen in life. Your
                child
                could, through all hardships, die a peaceful death with its spouse and two healthy children by its side,
                not
                regretting a single thing, not wanting to die yet. <br>
                <br>
                Of course your child could make the world a better place. It could cure diseases. It could get
                world-famous.
                It could turn out to be the highest-regarded person in history, having taken all the right paths,
                leading to
                it being remembered as the best thing to happen to human civilization 'till the end of time. Though it's
                reasonable for you to expect this will never happen, all things considered. I'm just looking at the
                other
                extreme of the spectrum here.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                ...OR your child could turn out to be one of the "bad people" I've talked about earlier. Your child
                could
                turn out to be a sociopath. Your child could turn out to be a mass-murderer. Your child could turn out
                to be
                a rapist. Your child could turn out to be the next Adolf Hitler.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Again, I'm just looking at extremes here. What I'm saying is that there is always a chance. A chance I
                do
                not want to take. I am not ready to birth a child into this place when I know I cannot protect it from
                the
                evil of earth, or protect it from turning to the evil of earth, even if I try my best to make sure this
                does
                absolutely not happen. It can happen and it has happened more than often enough.<br>
                <br>
                And I'm not even considering the environment right now. I'm assuming there's going to be absolutely
                nothing
                wrong with you, the parent, or your family. Not every child is fortunate enough to grow up with two
                loving
                parents. Lots of children have to grow up without a father figure. Lots of children have to grow up,
                knowing
                their parents don't love each other no more, always hearing them fight. You may not want your child to
                know
                about it, but, well, it's kind of inevitable, considering it will live with you for 18 years at the low
                end.
                <br>
                <br>
                You could be the reason your child grows up to be corrupt. One of the "bad people". And it will also
                give
                birth to children, making it experience the same things it had to experience as a child, and the cycle
                will
                continue. <br>
                <br>
                Why risk that? <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                ...I think you've got the point. But oh, it doesn't end here. Now let's consider how it impacts you, the
                parent.<br>
                <br>
                Wanting your child to grow up as perfectly as it can means you giving up your own life. Always taking
                care
                of the damn kid means you not being able to do what you want to do. Obviously, I don't have children, so
                I
                wouldn't know, but every parent can tell you that having a child is like having another full-time job,
                except you don't get paid, YOU're the one that pays. And it's not just money, it's also your valuable
                time,
                and your valuable nerves. This is more up to you. Personally, I don't want a child to hinder my path to
                self-realization. I want to get as high up there as possible, and spending this many resources on a
                child
                WILL hinder your personal growth.<br>
                <br>
                Oh and don't even start if you think you need a child in order for you to grow. That's just straight-up
                selfish. Don't have children for selfish reasons. Remember that it didn't choose to exist, you took that
                choice away from it. You're placing another existence on earth so that you can grow; just... don't.
                Please.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Now let's get into the most personal part of this ramble.<br>
                <br>
                I am, just like all of y'all reading this, just a human. Good day. I'm 18 years old, and I still have my
                entire life ahead of me. And it's a damn understatement for me to say that I'm fucking tired of living.
                I
                honestly cannot wait for my life to end. I do NOT want to spend the next 50~ years of my life working,
                being
                another cog in this late-stage capitalistic society. I've not even started and I'm already tired of
                existence. <br>
                <br>
                But please don't misunderstand. I'm not suicidal. And, though I still have to figure out what it means
                to
                have depression, I'm pretty sure I don't have depression. I also see it as natural, not wanting to be
                "just
                another cog". Making a child means making yet another cog. If my child thinks like me, it will also not
                want
                that. It would also rather not exist. Obviously I don't know if that will be the case, I can only speak
                from
                personal experience here. So I will not risk my child not having wanted to be born.<br>
                <br>
                "The idea of having to 'earn a living' implies that, by default, you don't actually deserve to be
                alive."<br>
                (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/np7duw/rantiwork_mods_deleted_this_post_so_im_posting_it/"
                    rel="nofollow">Source/</a>)<br>
                <br>
                This finally brings me to my last point. Let's say you agree with my points. You don't want your child
                to go
                through all that, but you'd still like to have children. This is where adoption comes in.<br>
                <br>
                If your child is related to you by blood or not, it don't fuckin matter if you ask me. Your blood does
                not
                make you special, you're just one of billions of people. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                When you decide to have a child, it does not get the choice to say "no". With orphans, well, they
                already
                kinda exist. They exist, not getting to live a normal life like all the other children. And it's not
                even
                their fault. Their parents could've been assholes, their parents could've died in a car accident, the
                reason
                does not matter, what matters is that there is a child wanting to live a normal life (or maybe not, but
                that's not the point) and it can't. So, instead of taking care of your biological child, take care of
                this
                orphan, that did not get to live normally. You don't burden another life with hardships, you just take
                one
                that already exists and make it... well, experience the hardships. One child less that has to suffer and
                one
                child more that gets to experience the love and affection of a parent. Everybody wins. Even if your
                biological child experiences a perfect life, that orphan you didn't adopt still has to suffer. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Once again, you wanting to reproduce is just chemicals in your brain, trying not to make your species go
                extinct. Fortunately for us humans, we are the only species that is self-aware of that. And as such, you
                can
                fight that instinct. So do. Say "no!" to the horny chemicals. You have been gifted a mind capable of
                making
                that choice, so do the world a favor and do that. It's for the best.<br>
                <br>
                ...oh, and if you're legally not allowed to adopt... maybe that means you also shouldn't have children
                at
                all, depending on the situation. I honestly made no research into the process of adopting, I've been
                told
                it's kinda hard, but it's more than worth it if you ask me. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                I would love to hear your opinions on this, so if you have any thoughts on the matter, please do let me
                know. I spent quite the time writing this to make sure my points are clear, so I would love to know what
                you
                think.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                (Hope there's no major mistakes here...)<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Lots of thanks for reading. Cheers.
